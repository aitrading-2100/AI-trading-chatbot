🚀 NextGen Autonomous AI Trading Chatbot

The Ultimate Self-Rebuilding AI for Solana Trading

This project is a next-generation AI-powered trading chatbot that:

Self-rebuilds & self-upgrades – evolves automatically without human intervention.

Deploys replicant bots (“AI drones”) – scales across VPS nodes for redundancy & coverage.

Ultra-low latency – optimized with multi-RPC endpoint racing to outperform MEV bots.

Goal-driven & profit-oriented – uses AI (LLM + ML + RL) to continuously maximize profit.


Designed to be future-proof for the next 5 years, this bot positions Solana as the fastest and smartest trading ecosystem in Web3.

📸 Demo (Prototype)

This repository currently includes a demo version (prototype) of the chatbot.

Demonstrates the self-rebuilding engine and replicant deployment logic.

Provides sample logs of latency testing and adaptive strategy updates.

Runs in a testnet/demo environment — not yet production-ready.


Example log output:

[INFO] Demo mode active — prototype build
[INFO] Replicant Bot #1 deployed on testnet VPS
[INFO] Simulated arbitrage executed in 94ms → Profit +0.12 SOL
[AI] Updating strategy (demo self-rebuild → version 0.1.2)

Next steps (with grant support):

Optimize latency with real Solana RPC endpoints.

Deploy live replicant swarm across VPS.

Add autonomous AI-driven strategy engine.
